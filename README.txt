---------- INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE if you want ----------

- open the dataProcessing.py file in an IDE with a python terminal
- make sure the directory of the terminal is the BScThesisAnalysis folder
- in the python terminal type: pip install -r requirements.txt
	- this ensures that all the required libraries are installed in your environment
- in the python terminal type: jupyter notebook
- on the window that appears, click on the analysis.ipynb file
- once you are in the analysis.ipynb file, run every cell to reproduce the analysis

---------- INFORMATION ON THE FILES ----------

This folder contains everything that is used for the final analysis.

In the folder "src" is the source code that I used to read process and analyze
the data. It should contain 4 python files and the subdirectory 
"BayesianMannWhitneyTest":
- dataProcessing --> this file reads and processes the data
- extras 	 --> contains a couple of functions that in the end were not 
		     used in the analysis
- simulation	 --> simulates data based on the sample mean and sd for
		     11, 15, 20, 30, 50, and 75 observations per group
- visualizations --> contains a couple of functions for boxplots and scatterplots

	BayesianMannWhitneyTest (the code is based on the source code of JASP)
	https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspTTests/blob/master/R/ttestbayesianindependentsamples.R
		- gibbs.py
		- truncation.py
		- BayesFactorWilcoxon.py 
  			--> these 3 files are used to run the analysis: 
			    a Bayesian Mann Whitney U test
      			    (which is also referred to as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test)

The demographic data and the volume data are in the inputData folder in excel files.

The volume data that I used for the analysis are in "inputData/volumeData".
These files were generated by the code to estimate the volume from the MRI delineations. 
	- The code for this is in "linuxEnvCode/get_volume.py".
	- This code only runs in a linux environment and needs the libraries 
	  "nighres" and "nibabel"

My MRI delineations are located in "inputData/mri_delineations"

The folder outputData contains the data the intermediate and final data,
on which the analysis is run.

The folder results contains two csv files
	- result.csv with the results of the analysis
	- simulatedBFs.csv with the results of the analysis on the simulated data

The analysis.ipynb is a jupyter notebook file, in which I run the src code.

The requirements.txt file contains all the required libraries for the code to run.

The "boxplots_MGN_vol.png" is a picture of the boxplots for each group.
The "scatterPlots_AgeVol.png" is a picture of the scatterplots for a age and MGN vol for each group

The analysis was also run in JASP, yielding the same result, and it is in the
"Bayesian MW U" file.
